- NGExtensions
  - Stuff I believe might be useful for later addition to NGExtensions framework

  - NGLogging
    - Had a look at log4cocoa, appeared to be too bloated (they mimic all of
      log4j which doesn't really make sense in Objective-C).
    - NGLogConsoleAppender is the only appender currently available, it's
      hardcoded in NGLogger as default. This should change as soon as we have
      a config for that purpose. Logging is low priority, so we don't need to
      do that too soon.
    - Syslog appender might be useful for the ministry. Syslog provides its own
      buffering, so syslog appender should be straight forward. Current
      implementation makes some fix assumptions (log facility).
