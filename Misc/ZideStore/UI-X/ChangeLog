	* Scheduler/UIxAppointmentEditor.m: improved -saveAction. Does
	  everything in a complete manner now - except for saving which isn't
	  done at all.

2004-06-30  Helge Hess  <helge.hess@opengroupware.org>

	* Scheduler/UIxAppointmentEditor.m: made the hack more hackish to work
	  on MacOSX

2004-06-28  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* Common/UIxComponent.[hm]: moved -ownMethodName here.

	* Scheduler/UIxCalView.[hm]: removed -ownMethodName, moved to
	  UIxComponent (reuse).

	* Scheduler/UIxAppointmentView.[hm]: first "draft" of view component.
	  The look of OGo is resembled closely, but most features are still
	  missing.

2004-06-28  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* Scheduler/GNUmakefile.preamble: links against libSOGoLogic now.

	* Scheduler/UIxAppointmentView.m, Scheduler/UIxAppointmentView.wox:
	  test of iCal object.

2004-06-23  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* UIxCalMonthOverview.[m,wox]: completed month view. Turned out to
	  be much more difficult to improve with style sheets than expected.
	  Requires version 4.2.45 of WEExtensions.

2004-06-22  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* Refactoring: Renamed everything from OGo to UIx in order to avoid
	  nameclashes (happens on OSX related to NGBundleManager)

	* Refactoring 2: Moved methods from UIxWeekOverview to UIxCalView.

	* Highlighting in UIxWeekOverview works now.

2004-06-22  Helge Hess  <helge.hess@skyrix.com>

	* Common/GNUmakefile.preamble: fixed linking for OGo gstep-make

2004-06-21  Helge Hess  <helge.hess@opengroupware.org>

	* Scheduler/OGoCalWeekOverview.m: fixed syntax errors

2004-06-18  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* Implemented proper calendar in week overview. Highlighting isn't
	  enabled, yet.

2004-06-18  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* Common/OGoComponent.[hm]: new component which serves as a base
	  component for calendar components now. Knows how to deal with
	  queryParameters and offers url construction method(s).

	* All existing components have been rewritten to use queryParameters
	  instead of hardcoded strings where this is feasible. This provides
	  future extensibility and flexibility.

	* Handling of dates has been fixed to center around the use of a
	  'day' parameter. startDate/endDate are coupled to this, but
	  don't override it as it's the duty of the individual view to set
	  its (feasible) ranges accordingly. The new behaviour is noticable
	  in the calendar selection tabview instantly, as it now replicates
	  what OGo does.

2004-06-16  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

2004-06-15  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* Common/UIxTabView.m: removed class from <a> tag, removed rendering
	  of headerFooter (what's that good for anyways?)

	  in templates.

	  superclass (now generic because we use the 'ownMethodName'). Could
	  even be moved to OGoCalView?
	
	* Scheduler/OGoCalMonthView.m: added next/prev month URL generation
	  methods, calculate startdate from form value

	* Scheduler/OGoCalView.m: added -ownMethodName method to return the
	  last path component of the request URL (the SOPE method), eg
	  'weekoverview' for OGoCalWeekView, added 
	  -dateNavigationURLWithNewStartDate: method to calculate 'startDate'
	  URLs (should be improved to include existing query parameters!)

	* Scheduler/OGoCalWeekOverview.m: minor tweaks ;-)

2004-06-03  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>
