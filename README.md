## What is SOGo?

SOGo is [fully supported](http://www.sogo.nu/support/commercial_support.html) and [trusted](http://www.sogo.nu/tour/testimonials.html) groupware server with a focus on scalability and open standards. SOGo is released under the GNU GPL/LGPL v2 and above.

SOGo provides a rich AJAX-based Web interface and supports multiple native clients through the use of standard protocols such as CalDAV, CardDAV and GroupDAV.

SOGo is the missing component of your infrastructure; it sits in the middle of your servers to offer your users an uniform and complete interface to access their information. It has been deployed in production environments where thousands of users are involved.

## Microsoft Outlook Compatible

SOGo offers native Microsoft Outlook compatibility using the [OpenChange](http://www.openchange.org/) backend developed by [Inverse](http://www.inverse.ca/). This means Microsoft Outlook 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013 can talk directly to SOGo &ndash; just like if it was a Microsoft Exchange server. **No plugins are required in Outlook to make this work**.

The following screencast shows Outlook 2010 connected to SOGo as if it was an Exchange server, along the Web interface of SOGo.
