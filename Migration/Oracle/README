Depending on your location, the timezone will have to be adjusted
in the oracleimport script. Search for "$timezone" and adjust it together
with the DTSTART/DTEND values.

Also, if you do not want the script to send invitation requests / updates
for virtually every PUT operation, you MUST add the SCHEDULE-AGENT parameter
(with a value of NONE or CLIENT) to the ORGANIZER of the events you're about
to import. See http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-desruisseaux-caldav-sched-08#section-10.1
for all details. 

Then, you need to export the data from Oracle Calendar. To do this, use
the following tools based on the type of data you want to export.

- Calendars -

% uniical -export -host <hostname:port> -n <nodeid> -start <month>/<day>/<year> -end <month>/<day>/<year> -u <username>  -f <filename>

- Tasks -

% unicpoutu -host <hostname:port> -n <nodeid> -start <day> <month> <year> -end <day> <month> <year> -u <username>

- Rights -

% uniaccessrights -ls  -grantor <user> -host <hostname:port> -n <nodeid>  -p XXXX -grantee "S=*" -designate

details on those tools.
