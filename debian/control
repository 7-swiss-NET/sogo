Description: SOGo
 SOGo is a groupware server built around OpenGroupware.org (OGo) and
 the SOPE application server.  It focuses on scalability.
 The Inverse edition of this project has many feature enhancements:
 - CalDAV and GroupDAV compliance
 - full handling of vCard as well as vCalendar/iCalendar formats
 - support for folder sharing and ACLs
 The Web interface has been rewritten in an AJAX fashion to provided a faster
 UI for the users, consistency in look and feel with the Mozilla applications,
 and to reduce the load of the transactions on the server.
